    <h1>Work Progress</h1>
    <p>
        This is Work Progress official website. <br>
        This extension for Visual studio code was created by me (<a href ="https://github.com/andrinoff">Drey Smirnoff</a>) in the free time <br>
        <br>
        This project is not funded, does not have a domain. <br>
        I will still update it, add new features, but the email will have to use EmailJS, which was repeatedly reported as spam, and will most likely be moved there. <br>
        <br>
        IF you would like to support the project, i have a patreon (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/andrinoff">andrinoff</a>) <br>
        Once, i have enough support, i will buy a domain and host everything on my own. <br>
        <br>
        I am not a professional developer, i am just a guy who loves to code and create things. <br>
        I am not a designer, so the website may not look great, but it works. <br>
